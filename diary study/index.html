                            A senior UX researcher Aidan Bryant describes diary studies as research that takes place over a long period with the same participants. Users have to self-report their activities at regular intervals to create a log of their activities, thoughts, and frustrations.

                        In this stage, my team start from understanding our client’s goal. The client wants to understand people’s current behaviour, emotions, and experiences listening to audio entertainment.<br> We frame the research topic before defining the research question and brainstormed which topic can help the client to reach their goal most. Then, we came out motivation as our research topic. To be more specific, we listed out four factors of motivation — age, an expectation of gain, inspiration, and emotion. Next, generate these factors into research questions. <br>
                        <br>Finally, we satisfied most with the research question of emotion. <br>

Participants will be encouraged to submit more if they feel it is appropriate. Each team member of user experience research will be assigned a participant to assist and monitor throughout the study.<br><br>Additionally, each participant will be assigned a participant ID for privacy and secure coding of data for analysis.

                    Moreover, adding participant ID and time order can help us know the post-it is from which response, and easier to organize the amount of data. Finally, our post-it becomes below format.

                    The interesting part we first noticed is some of our participants express their feeling changed after listening to the audio even we didn’t ask their feelings after an audio experience.<br><br>

                    We also found the definition of genre/audio type is different by each. For example, classical music may be calming to one person, but boring to another person.

                <h6 class="articleS">
                    Most people who are tired would like to listen to the audio which can help them change the emotion and become relaxed. However, the genre of audio depends on the user’s habit. There is no specific genre for every user to relax.<br><br>

                    The users who are calm or excited would like to listen to specific audio content which can maintain and match their current emotional state.<br><br>

                    Participants who are waiting or commuting with negative emotions such as frustrated, tired, and anxious used random audio or the audio they accustomed to listening. To keep themselves occupied and pass the time. They did not care about the genre of audio.

                    <br><br>
                    Nevertheless, the emotion would not be the main factor for users to choose audio to listen for the scenario below.
                    Participants who would like to focus on what they are doing and being concentrate will listen to the audio to avoid distraction. In this scenario, their emotions are diverse, environment and situational factors have more influence than emotion.

                    This project was an excellent opportunity for us to learn how to run a Diary study, how to apply Affinity diagram, and how to collaborate with diverse background teammate. In this team, we come from different countries, Canada, India, Turkey, China, and Taiwan. The first challenge for us is not how to settle a research question, actually is how to break the language barriers to share and understand each other’s ideas.
                    <br><br>Retrospective this project, here are some points I will keep in mind next time.
                    <br><br>Setting the research question and study question is the crucial foundation of this project. Therefore, we need to think profoundly and adjusted study questions numerous times.
                    <br><br>
                    The hardest part of this project is analyzing data. We had been struggling in Affinity diagramming. While we generated Affinity diagram, I deeply understand why teamwork is essential. Having different insight is very helpful to create an Affinity Diagram, everyone is equal. There is no leader in this stage.
                    <br><br>
                    Lastly, the improvement of this project I would like to try next time is to have more communication with participants. I realized some of our participants gave us unclear or unfollowed instructions responses. It will be better for us to have more contact with our participants and lead them to provide us with a clear and valid answer.
